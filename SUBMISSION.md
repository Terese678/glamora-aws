# Glamora - Decentralized Fashion Marketplace
## AWS Global Vibe Hackathon Submission

---

##  The Problem & Solution

Traditional fashion platforms take 30-50% commissions from creators and control content ownership. **Glamora** empowers independent fashion creators to monetize their work directly, keeping 95% of sales through Web3 technology and AWS infrastructure.

**Why This Matters:** Built for my son Nathaniel. I'm creating a future where creators have true ownership and fair compensation for their work.

##  How We Used Amazon Q - Our AI Architect

Amazon Q wasn't just a code generator it was our technical consultant for every major decision.

### 1. **Generated Production-Ready Lambda Functions**
Asked Q to create 5 complete TypeScript Lambda functions with DynamoDB schemas, Web3 wallet authentication, IPFS integration, and error handling. Saved 8+ hours.

### 2. **Made Critical Architecture Decisions**
Consulted Q on **DynamoDB vs RDS** for our use case. Q provided cost breakdown, performance analysis, and code examples. **Decision:** DynamoDB saves $170/month at scale while delivering sub-100ms response times.

### 3. **Designed Security From Day One**
Asked Q about securing wallet authentication, IPFS uploads, and transactions. Q provided replay attack prevention, Lambda security configs, and rate limiting strategies. 

### 4. **Optimized CloudFront + IPFS Integration**
Q designed our caching strategy for IPFS content via CloudFront. 

### 5. **Planned For Scale**
Q helped architect auto-scaling from 10k to 100k+ users with cost projections at each stage. 
**Proof:** screenshots documenting every Q interaction across code generation, architecture, security, performance, and cost optimization.

##  Built For Nathaniel

This project represents the transparent, equitable platform I want to exist when my son grows up. Amazon Q made it possible to build production-quality infrastructure in 2 weeks - something that would have taken months alone.
